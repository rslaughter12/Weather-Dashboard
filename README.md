Description
This website was created to give the user a quick and easy way to look up current and upcoming forecast for a city of their choice. 

Usage
On the start screen the user is met with a title that then can click on to refresh the page (bring them back home). A seach bar, and then directions. The user is instructed to search a city, when the user hits submit then the page populates the data and information that is connected to the city that they searched, as well as removing the direction information. The cities that the user searches are storred in their local storage and will be populated as buttons that they can use to easily and quickly return to the forecast of a prior city. This data can be cleared from their local storage by clicing on the "Clear History Button".
